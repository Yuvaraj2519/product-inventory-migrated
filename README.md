# React CRA to Vite

This project is to migrate react app from CRA to vite which i did choose my old react

Currently, CRA is deprecated and should start moving to vite:

## Steps i followed
- Create new project folder using `npm create vite@latest`
- Choose react and js + SWC for fast load
- Replace `index.html` content from vite with your app. Need to look up and replace scripts, icons etc.,
- Install pending dependencies and correct errors
- And there you good to go

# Note

It is much faster than old and with SWC
